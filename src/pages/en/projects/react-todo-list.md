#### GitHub Repository

The repository is available here:  [ToDo List Github](https://github.com/Kathleen-Vierstraete/react-todolist "React Todo List GitHub")

#### Application features

The user can see the full list :

![Todo List Homepage](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-home.png 'Todo List Homepage')

It is possible to add a task via the input on top of the list :

![Todo List Add](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-add.png 'Todo List Add')

It is possible to edit a task when cliking on the pencil button :

![Todo List Edit](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-edit.png 'Todo List Edit')

Once validated, the modified task is displayed in the list :

![Todo List Edit Done](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-edit-done.png 'Todo List Edit Done')

It is also possible to delete a task from the list, when clicking on the trash button :

![Todo List Delete](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-delete.png 'Todo List Delete')

One the task is complete, it is possible to cross it out when clicking on it :

![Todo List Task Done](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-task-done.png 'Todo List Task Done')

It is possible to select a language to make the navigation easier :
 
![Todo List Language](../../../../public/assets/images/todolist/todo-language.png 'Todo List Language')

This feature was set up via i18next, Javascript framework.
