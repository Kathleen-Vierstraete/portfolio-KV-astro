The resquest from the client was to create a new sign for his bakery, with an image as a basis to work with.

#### Base image

The client gave an image as an inspiration for his new bakery sign :

![Base Image](../../../../public/assets/images/enseigne-boulangerie/calque-base-bakery.PNG 'Base image')

#### Setting the resquests and presenting the finish products

The sign was to be in two parts : the ovoid one was to present the bakery and the rectangle shaped sign was to give additional information.
After talks and suggestions to the client, the final design was validated :

![finished signed part 1](../../../../public/assets/images/enseigne-boulangerie/enseigne-black-white.png 'finished signed part 1')

![finished signed part 2](../../../../public/assets/images/enseigne-boulangerie/plaque-black-white.png 'finished signed part 2')

#### Designs given to the painter for an easier work

To easy the work of the painter, the designs were merely outligned :

![outline sign part 2](../../../../public/assets/images/enseigne-boulangerie/plaque-trace.jpg 'plaque image tracée')


#### Set up sign
Once his work completed and the sign fully set up, the painter was kind enough to give a picture of the final product :
